This document tries to describe the tagging scheme/provide rules of thumb for tagging games consistently.
Once it's written, anyway.

Status tags
===========

SS uses 'complete', 'demo', 'tech demo', 'very incomplete', 'abandoned', 'not available' (only 2x) etc.
CP uses 'In production', 'Final', 'Demo'.
OpOHR uses 'No demo', 'Demo released', 'Finished game'.

CP's and OpOHR's labels are mapped when scrapping to 'in production', 'demo',
'complete', 'no demo'; although 'Final' maybe isn't the same thing as
'Complete'.

(I've also additionally tagged an CP 'in production' game with 'demo' if it has
a download or 'no demo' if it doesn't, and changed a few Op:OHR games which were
'No demo' but did have a download to 'demo'.)
