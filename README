OHR Archive
===========

A grand unified cross-referenced archive of OHRRPGCE games and reviews.
Website, crawler, aggregator, archive, gamedata inspector, browser, web-based game player.
Work in progress. Early days still.
Data from all OHR gamelists and review website will eventually be imported.

Written in pure Python. Works with at least Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.5, 3.6.

To download the database files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(This is optional, but there won't be any content on the website otherwise!)

Download the database files containing the gamelists from
http://tmc.castleparadox.com/ohr/archive/databases/
and place them in the src/databases/ directory.

To crawl the gamelists:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Optional; this takes a while, so you're better off following the instructions
above to download the pre-imported copies of the databases)

Modules to install:
 bs4   (BeautifulSoup 4)
 lxml  Optional - for faster html parsing

> cd src
> ./pull_castleparadox.py
> ./pull_slimesalad.py
> ./pull_google_play.py
These scripts cache all files they download to src/download_cache/
(about 109MB in total currently) and will not ever download them
again. They also copy the screenshots to src/data/. .zip files are not
downloaded.

To process .zip/.rpg files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This isn't automated yet; you need to provide your own archive of .zip,
.rpgdir or .rpg files. Then feed them on the commandline to src/process_rpgs.py.
See src/process_cp_archive.sh for an example.

To host the website:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> cd web
> ./local_server.py
Then visit http://localhost:8007

The website uses WSGI so can be hosted using any server directly supporting
Python webapps. Also, see web/.htaccess to run using Apache's mod_python.
Also web/flupserve.py is a FastCGI interface for the website, but doesn't
seem to work with Apache 2.2.
