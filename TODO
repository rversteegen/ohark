- Game descriptions containing relative img tags (namely, smileys) should have the urls
  updated. For example  http://www.slimesalad.com/forum/viewgame.php?t=4630

- There are 19 games on SS with .rar downloads. There are also some games with .tar.gz files,
  but those are just the Mac, and sometimes Linux, versions of games with an alternative
  download.
